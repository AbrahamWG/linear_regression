# Linear Regression from Scratch 📈

A comprehensive, educational implementation of Linear Regression using only NumPy and Matplotlib - no scikit-learn for the core algorithm!

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds a complete Linear Regression model from the ground up to understand exactly how machine learning algorithms work under the hood. Instead of using black-box libraries, we implement every component ourselves: gradient descent, cost functions, weight updates, and visualization.

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

- **100% From Scratch**: Every line of the ML algorithm is written and explained
- **Educational Focus**: Step-by-step breakdown with clear explanations
- **Visual Learning**: Multiple plots showing training progress, predictions, and residuals
- **Real Comparison**: Side-by-side results with scikit-learn implementation
- **Interactive**: Jupyter notebook format with runnable code

## 📊 Dataset

Uses the famous **Diabetes Dataset** from scikit-learn:
- **442 patients** with diabetes
- **10 physiological features** (age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, etc.)
- **Target**: Disease progression after one year
- Perfect for demonstrating regression concepts!

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

- ✅ How gradient descent actually finds optimal solutions
- ✅ Why cost functions measure model performance  
- ✅ How learning rates affect training speed and stability
- ✅ What residual plots reveal about model quality
- ✅ The difference between MSE and R² metrics
- ✅ How professional libraries compare to custom implementations

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. **Interactive Gradient Descent**
Watch your model learn in real-time with decreasing cost curves:

- Initial Cost: **14,537** → Final Cost: **2,784** (80% reduction!)
- Training time: **0.26 seconds**
- Smooth, stable learning curve

### 2. **Comprehensive Visualizations**
Three essential plots for understanding model performance:
- **Training Progress**: See cost decrease over epochs
- **Predictions vs Actual**: Evaluate prediction accuracy
- **Residual Plot**: Check for patterns in errors

### 3. **Professional Comparison**
Direct comparison with scikit-learn:

| Metric | Our Model | Scikit-Learn | 
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| MSE | 2,784.36 | 3,890.46 |
| R² Score | 0.0610 | 0.3439 |
| Training Time | 0.26s | 0.021s |
